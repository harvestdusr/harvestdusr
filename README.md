- 👋 Hi, I’m @harvestdusr. I don't have anything to hide, but I don't have anything to show you either.
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux, Privacy, DeGoogling, Gaming and Open Source.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software that respects Libre principles and provides alternatives to targeting, tracking and harvesting user data as a business model in technology.
- 📫 Reach me at wm97hthp@duck.com
